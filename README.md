# Acknowledgements

This project is built upon the foundational work of two significant repositories in the open-source community.

Firstly, I extend my gratitude to [Codebushi](https://github.com/codebushi) for the original [Gatsby Starter Dimension
repository](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension). This repository has been instrumental in providing a
robust and adaptable starting point for Gatsby projects.

Secondly, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of [Donald Boulton](https://github.com/donaldboulton) in enhancing the
original project. His forked
version, [Gatsby Starter Dimension V4](https://github.com/donaldboulton/gatsby-starter-dimension-v4), introduced updates
and modifications that further refined the project. These improvements have provided additional functionality and have
helped in aligning the project more closely with current web standards.

Additionally, this project utilizes the [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) [Dimension](https://html5up.net/dimension)
template by [@ajlkn](https://github.com/ajlkn), a testament to the innovative and versatile web design
possibilities offered by HTML5. The integration of this template has been pivotal in achieving the desired aesthetic and
functional outcomes for the project.
